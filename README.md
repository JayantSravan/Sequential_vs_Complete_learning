# Sequential_vs_Complete_learning

## Assignment 1
<p>The objective is to obtain a posterior distribution from randomly generated data and an apriori Beta distribution having a mean 0.4. Here we wish to compare and contrast the posterior distributions taken one at a time to all the data points taken simeltaniously.</p>

## Assignment 2
<p>The objective is to calculate the value of PI with the help of an approximation. This makes use of an approximation which helps us convert integral as a probabilistic approximation.</p>
